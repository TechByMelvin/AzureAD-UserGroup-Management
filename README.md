## üìå Project Overview

This project simulates a real-world cloud-based identity and access management scenario using Microsoft Entra ID. I created users, assigned them to departmental security groups, and configured directory roles that reflect common IT Help Desk responsibilities.

It demonstrates my hands-on knowledge of user provisioning, access management, and directory role assignments in a modern IT environment.
